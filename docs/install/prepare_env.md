Before you start it please make sure the folder structure exists.

```shell
# create the empty directories, if needed
mkdir -p rules config db oz
# create an empty ui.json for the wizard of oz.
echo "[]" > oz/ui.json
```
This creates an empty custom UI for the Wizard and the needed empty folders to start the container.
