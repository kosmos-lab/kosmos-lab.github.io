## KosmoS Rule Engine Editor (KREE)

KREE is a block-based programming interface on top of the KosmoS Platform.
It is based on [https://developers.google.com/blockly](Google Blockly) and generates python code that will be launched directly from the KosmoS Platform

???+ bug "needs work"
    It is used in production already but still needs to be updated to the new python library. There also needs to be a wider variety of blocks to use, currently they are limited to generic blocks and some blocks based on the ConText use case.
